# Binary_Classification_Bank_Churn
 For this Episode of the Series, your task is to predict whether a customer continues with their account or closes it (e.g., churns). Good luck!
# Dataset Description
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Bank Customer Churn Prediction dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.
